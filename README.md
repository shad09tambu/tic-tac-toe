Tic-Tac-Toe
The game is to be played between two people (in this program between HUMAN and HUMAN).
One of the player chooses ‘yellow’ and the other ‘red’ to mark their respective cells.
The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has one whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective coins (‘yellow’ or ‘red’).
If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw.
